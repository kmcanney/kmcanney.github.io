        <h2><a name="kanchor55"></a>Creating a Submix Using Busses</h2>
        <p>When you start a new project, all audio tracks are routed to the master 
 bus. In this configuration, you can adjust the volume of your individual 
 audio tracks to establish the mix, and you can adjust the master bus to 
 raise or lower the overall volume of your projects.</p>
        <p>If you're creating more complicated audio projects, you will likely 
 want more control over your project. For example, imagine your horns were 
 recorded to several tracks. If you decided that your mix was nearly perfect, 
 but you wanted to bring out the horns just a bit, you could adjust the 
 <span class="uielement">Volume</span> fader on 
 each horn track. However, it would be much faster to submix your horn 
 tracks to a dedicated bus: with a submix, you can adjust the overall level 
 of the submixed tracks without changing their overall levels, add effects, 
 and mute or solo the submix.</p>
        <hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online" />
        <p>In this sample project, notice that we have eight tracks that are all 
 routed to the Master bus and that the levels of tracks 4-8 have been adjusted 
 to mix the horns.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/submix1.gif" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>First, let's click the <span class="uielement">Insert 
 Bus</span> button <img src="Resources/Images/B_INSERTBUS.GIF" /> in the Mixing Console window to create a new bus for 
 our submix. </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>By default, the bus is named Bus A. Let's double-click 
 the bus label in the Mixing Console window and type "Horns" 
 in the box to give our submix bus a more descriptive name.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="Resources/Images/LOC/renamebus.gif" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Now we need to route our horn tracks to the new submix bus.</p>
            </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li value="1">
                    <p>Hold Shift and click the track 
 icon on track 4.</p>
                </li>
                <li value="2">
                    <p>Continue holding Shift and click 
 the track icon on track 8. Tracks 4-8 are now selected.</p>
                </li>
                <li value="3">
                    <p>Click the bus icon on any selected 
 track and choose <span class="uielement">Bus 
 A (Horns)</span> from the menu. The selected tracks are now all assigned 
 to the submix bus.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="Resources/Images/LOC/submix2.gif" />
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>When you look at the project now, you'll see that the track 
 headers for tracks 4-8 display an <img src="Resources/Images/b_bus.gif" /> to indicate that they're routed to bus A: 
 </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/submix3.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>In the Mixing Console window, Bus A displays <span class="uielement">Master</span> 
 to indicate that it is routed to the master bus: the horn tracks are still 
 part of the master mix because they're routed from the track to Bus A 
 and then back to the Master bus.</p>
        <p>You can use bus 
 channel strips in the Mixing Console to adjust the level of the submixed 
 tracks, add effects to the submix, or mute and solo the submix. For more information, see <a href="SPCONSOLEOPT_Bus_Channel_Strips.htm" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod" xrefformat="{quote}{color #009ccc}{u}{paratext}{/u}{/color}.{quote}">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Bus Channel Strips</u></span>."</a> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>If you want to automate volume, panning, and effects parameters 
 over time, you can use envelopes on the submix bus 
 track. For example, if you wanted to make all the horn tracks quieter 
 during a verse and louder during a bridge, you could apply a volume envelope 
 to the submix bus track.

        <h4>Adaptive Delta Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM)<a name="Adaptive"></a></h4>
        <p>A method of compressing audio data. Although the theory 
 for compression using ADPCM is standard, there are many different algorithms 
 employed. For example, Microsoft's ADPCM algorithm is not compatible with 
 the International Multimedia Association's (IMA) approved ADPCM.</p>
        <h4>A-Law<a name="Alaw"></a></h4>
        <p><a name="kanchor794"></a>A compounded compression algorithm for voice signals defined 
 by the Geneva Recommendations (G.711). The G.711 recommendation defines 
 A-Law as a method of encoding 16-bit PCM signals into a non-linear 8-bit 
 format. The algorithm is commonly used in United States' telecommunications. 
 A-Law is very similar to µ-Law, however, each uses a slightly different 
 coder and decoder.</p>
        <h4><a name="Aliasing"></a>Aliasing</h4>
        <p>A type of distortion that occurs when digitally recording 
 high frequencies with a low sample rate. For example, in a motion picture, 
 when a car's wheels appear to slowly spin backward while the car is quickly 
 moving forward, you are seeing the effects of aliasing. Similarly when 
 you try to record a frequency greater than one half of the sampling rate 
 (the Nyquist Frequency), instead of hearing a high pitch, you may hear 
 a low-frequency rumble.</p>
        <p>To prevent aliasing, an anti-aliasing filter is used to 
 remove high-frequencies before recording. Once the sound has been recorded, 
 aliasing distortion is impossible to remove without also removing other 
 frequencies from the sound. This same anti-aliasing filter must be applied 
 when resampling to a lower sample rate.</p>
        <h4>Alpha Channel<a name="alpha_channel"></a></h4>
        <p>Alpha is a fourth channel that determines how transparency 
 is handled in an image file. The RGB channels are blended to determine 
 each pixel's color, and the corresponding alpha channel determines each 
 pixel's transparency. The alpha channel can have up to 256 shades of gray: 
 0 represents a transparent pixel, 255 represents an opaque pixel, and 
 intermediate values are semitransparent.</p>
        <h4>Amplitude Modulation (AM)<a name="AM"></a></h4>
        <p>A process whereby the amplitude (loudness) of a sound is 
 varied over time. When varied slowly, a tremolo effect occurs. If the 
 frequency of modulation is high, many side frequencies are created which 
 can strongly alter the timbre of a sound.</p>
        <h4><a name="Analog"></a>Analog</h4>
        <p>When discussing audio, this term refers to a method of reproducing 
 a sound wave with voltage fluctuations that are analogous to the pressure 
 fluctuations of the sound wave. This is different from digital recording 
 in that these fluctuations are infinitely varying rather than discrete 
 changes at sample time. See <a href="#Quantization" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Quantization</u></span>."</a></p>
        <h4><a name="Aspect"></a>Aspect Ratio</h4>
        <p>Describes the frame size of your video as a ratio of its 
 width to its height. For example, video shot in NTSC DV format has a frame 
 size of 720 by 480 pixels, which is roughly a 1.33:1 aspect ratio:</p>
        <p>720 (frame width) ÷ 480 (frame 
 height) = 1.5 </p>
        <p>1.5 x 0.9091 (pixel aspect ratio) 
 = 1.36365. </p>

        <h4><a name="attack"></a>Attack</h4>
        <p>The attack of a sound is the initial portion of the sound. 
 Percussive sounds (drums, piano, guitar plucks) are said to have a fast 
 attack. This means that the sound reaches its maximum amplitude in a very 
 short time. Sounds that slowly swell up in volume (soft strings and wind 
 sounds) are said to have a slow attack.</p>
        <h4>Audio Compression Manager (ACM)<a name="ACM"></a></h4>
        <p>The Audio Compression Manager, from Microsoft, is a standard 
 interface for audio compression and signal processing for the Windows 
 operating system. The ACM can be used by software to compress and decompress 
 .wav files.</p>
        <h3 class="glossary"><a name="Glossary-B"></a>B&#160;<a href="#TOP" title="Go to top" alt="Go to top"><img src="Resources/Images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Go to top" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online" /></a></h3>
        <h4><a name="Bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth</h4>
        <p>When discussing audio equalization, each frequency band 
 has a width associated with it that determines the range of frequencies 
 that are affected by the EQ. An EQ band with a wide bandwidth will affect 
 a wider range of frequencies than one with a narrow bandwidth.</p>
        <p>When discussing network connections, refers to the rate 
 of signals transmitted; the amount of data that can be transmitted in 
 a fixed amount of time (stated in bits/second): a 56 Kbps network connection 
 is capable of receiving 56,000 bits of data per second.</p>
        <h4>Beats Per Measure<a name="BeatsPerMeas"></a></h4>
        <p>The time signature of a piece of music contains two pieces 
 of information: the number of beats in each measure of music, and which 
 note value gets one beat. <span class="PrimaryProductName_Legal">Vegas® Pro</span> uses this notion to determine 
 the number of ticks to put on the time ruler above the track view and 
 to determine the spacing when the ruler is displaying Measures &amp; Beats.</p>
        <h4>Beats Per Minute (BPM)<a name="BPM"></a></h4>
        <p>The tempo of a piece of music can be written as a number 
 of beats in one minute. If the tempo is 60 BPM, a single beat will occur 
 once every second.</p>
        <h4>Bit<a name="Bit"></a></h4>
        <p>A bit is the most elementary unit in digital systems. Its 
 value can only be 1 or 0, corresponding to a voltage in an electronic 
 circuit. Bits are used to represent values in the binary numbering system. 
 As an example, the 8-bit binary number 10011010 represents the unsigned 
 value of 154 in the decimal system. In digital sampling, a binary number 
 is used to store individual sound levels, called samples.</p>
        <h4>Bit Depth<a name="BitDepth"></a></h4>
        <p>The number of bits used to represent a single sample. <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> 
 software uses either 8, 16 or 24-bit samples. Higher values will increase 
 the quality of the playback and any recordings that you make. While 8-bit 
 samples take up less memory (and hard disk space), they are inherently 
 noisier than 16 or 24-bit samples.</p>
        <h4>Brightness<a name="Brightness"></a></h4>
        <p>Adjusting brightness adds or subtracts values from the color 
 channels in an image to make the image lighter or darker. The maximum 
 brightness setting adds 255 (pure white), and the minimum setting adds 
 0 (pure black).</p>
        <h4>Bus<a name="bus"></a></h4>
        <p>A virtual pathway where signals from tracks and effects 
 are mixed. A bus's output is a physical audio device in the computer where 
 the signal is routed. The configuration of busses is saved with the project 
 whereas the routing of busses to hardware is saved with the system. In 
 this way, projects can be easily moved from one system to another without 
 modifying the original layout of the project.</p>
        <h4><a name="Byte"></a>Byte</h4>
        <p>Refers to a set of 8 bits. An 8-bit sample requires one 
 byte of memory to store, while a 16-bit sample takes two bytes of memory 
 to store.</p>
        <h3 class="glossary"><a name="Glossary-C"></a>C&#160;<a href="#TOP" title="Go to top" alt="Go to top"><img src="Resources/Images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Go to top" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online" /></a></h3>
        <h4><a name="CCD"></a>CCD
        </h4>
        <p>Charge coupled device. The image sensor in a digital camera.</p>
        <h4><a name="Chroma"></a>Chroma</h4>
        <p>The values that convey chrominance information. </p>
        <h4>Chrominance</h4>
        <p>The color content of an image without respect to its brightness. 
 </p>
        <h4><a name="Clipboard"></a>Clipboard</h4>
        <p>The clipboard is where data that you have cut or copied 
 is stored. You can then paste the data back into a different location 
 on the <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> timeline or paste it into other applications, such as Microsoft 
 Word, or another instance of <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span>.</p>
        <h4><a name="Clipping"></a>Clipping</h4>
        <p>Clipping is what occurs when the amplitude of a sound is 
 above the maximum allowed recording level. In digital systems, clipping 
 is seen as a clamping of the data to a maximum value, such as 32,767 in 
 16-bit data. Clipping causes sound to distort.</p>
        <h4><a name="CODEC"></a>CODEC</h4>
        <p>An acronym for Coder/Decoder. Commonly used when working 
 with data compression.</p>
        <h4>Complementary Color<a name="Complementary"></a></h4>
        <p>Complementary colors are colors that are 180 degrees apart 
 on the color wheel. In the following image, you can see that red and cyan 
 are complementary colors, as are magenta and green, and blue and yellow.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/colorwheel.gif" />
        </p>
        <h4>Contrast<a name="Contrast"></a></h4>
        <p>Adjusting contrast multiplies color values in an image to 
 stretch the existing color channel values across a broader or narrower 
 portion of the spectrum. The contrast center determines the anchor point 
 for stretching.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Contrast decreased with a contrast center of 
 0.5: the histogram is squeezed into a narrower portion of the spectrum 
 anchored from the center of the graph.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/LOC/contrasthisto3.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Contrast decreased with a contrast center of 
 0.0: the histogram is squeezed into a narrower portion of the spectrum 
 anchored at the left edge of the graph.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/LOC/contrasthisto4.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Contrast decreased with a contrast center of 
 1.0: the histogram is squeezed into a narrower portion of the spectrum 
 anchored at the right edge of the graph.</p>
        <h4><a name="Crossfade"></a>Crossfade</h4>
        <p>Mixing two pieces of media by fading one out as the other 
 fades in.</p>
        <h4>Cutoff frequency<a name="Cutoff"></a></h4>
        <p>The cutoff-frequency of a filter is the frequency at which 
 the filter changes its response. For example, in a low-pass filter, frequencies 
 greater than the cutoff frequency are attenuated while frequencies less 
 than the cutoff frequency are not affected.</p>
        <h3 class="glossary"><a name="Glossary-D"></a>D&#160;<a href="#TOP" title="Go to top" alt="Go to top"><img src="Resources/Images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Go to top" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online" /></a></h3>
        <h4>DC Offset<a name="DCoffset"></a></h4>
        <p>DC Offset occurs when hardware, such as a sound card, adds 
 DC current to a recorded audio signal. This current causes the audio signal 
 to alternate around a point above or below the normal -infinity dB (center) 
 line in the sound file. To visually see if you have a DC offset present, 
 you can zoom all the way into a sound file and see if it appears to be 
 floating over the center line. In the following example, the red line 
 represents 0 dB. The lower waveform exhibits DC offset; note that the 
 waveform is centered approximately 2 dB above the baseline.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/dcoffset.gif" />
        </p>
        <h4>Decibel (dB)<a name="dB"></a></h4>
        <p>A unit used to represent a ratio between two numbers using 
 a logarithmic scale. For example, when comparing the numbers 14 and 7, 
 you could say 14 is two times greater than the number 7; or you could 
 say 14 is 6 dB greater than the number 7. Where did we pull that 6 dB 
 from? Engineers use the equation dB = 20 x log (V1/V2) when comparing 
 two instantaneous values. Decibels are commonly used when dealing with 
 sound because the ear perceives loudness in a logarithmic scale.</p>
        <p>In <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span>, most measurements are given in decibels. 
 For example, if you want to double the amplitude of a sound, you apply 
 a 6 dB gain. A sample value of 32,767 (maximum positive sample value for 
 16-bit sound) can be referred to as having a value of 0 dB. Likewise, 
 a sample value of 16,384 can be referred to having a value of -6 dB.</p>
        <h4>Device Driver<a name="DeviceDrv"></a></h4>
        <p>A program that enables the Windows operating system to connect 
 different hardware and software. For example, a sound card device driver 
 is used by software to control sound card recording and playback.</p>
        <h4>Digital Signal Processing (DSP)<a name="kanchor795"></a><a name="DSP"></a></h4>
        <p>A general term describing anything that alters digital data. 
 Signal processors have existed for a very long time (tone controls, distortion 
 boxes, wah-wah pedals) in the analog (electrical) domain. Digital Signal 
 Processors alter the data after it has been digitized by using a combination 
 of programming and mathematical techniques. DSP techniques are used to 
 perform many effects such as equalization and reverb simulation.</p>
        <p>Since most DSP is performed with simple arithmetic operations 
 (additions and multiplications), both your computer's processor and specialized 
 DSP chips can be used to perform any DSP operation. The difference is 
 that DSP chips are optimized specifically for mathematical functions while 
 your computer's microprocessor is not. This results in a difference in 
 processing speed.</p>
        <h4><a name="Dithering"></a>Dithering</h4>
        <p>The practice of adding noise to a signal to mask quantization 
 noise.</p>
        <h4><a name="DragDrop"></a>Drag and Drop</h4>
        <p>A quick way to perform certain operations using the mouse 
 in <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span>. To drag and drop, you click and hold a highlighted 
 selection, drag it (hold the left-mouse button down and move the mouse) 
 and drop it (let go of the mouse button) at another position on the screen.</p>
        <h4><a name="Dynamic"></a>Dynamic Range<a name="kanchor796"></a></h4>
        <p>The difference between the maximum and minimum signal levels. 
 It can refer to a musical performance (high volume vs. low volume signals) 
 or to electrical equipment (peak level before distortion vs. noise floor). 
 For example, orchestral music has a wide dynamic range while thrash metal 
 has a very small (always loud) range.</p>
        <h3 class="glossary"><a name="Glossary-E"></a>E&#160;<a href="#TOP" title="Go to top" alt="Go to top"><img src="Resources/Images/top.gif" border="0" alt="Go to top" data-mc-conditions="Primary.Online" /></a></h3>
        <h4>Endian (Little and Big)<a name="Endian"></a></h4>
        <p>Little and Big Endian describe the ordering of multi-byte 
 data that is used by a computer's microprocessor. Little Endian specifies 
 that data is stored in a low to high-byte format; this ordering is used 
 by the Intel microprocessors. Big Endian specifies that data is stored 
 in a high to low-byte format; this ordering is used by the Motorola microprocessors.</p>
        <h4>Envelopes (Audio and Video)<a name="Envelopes"></a></h4>
        <p>Envelopes allow you to automate the change of a certain 
 parameter over time. In the case of volume envelopes, you can create a 
 fade out (which requires a change over time) by adding an envelope and 
 creating an extra point to the line that indicates where the fade starts. 
 Then you pull the end point of the envelope down to infinity.</p>
        <h4>Equalization (EQ)<a name="EQ"></a></h4>
        <p>The process by which certain frequency bands are raised 
 or lowered in level. EQ has various uses. The most common use for <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> 
 users is to simply adjust the subjective timbral qualities of a sound.</p>

        <p data-mc-conditions="Primary.ProOnly">Essence marks can be saved in XDCAM clips during shooting. 
 These markers can indicate record start/end times, shot marks, flash, 
 filter/gain/shutter speed/white balance changes, or audio clipping. In 
 <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span>, essence marks can be displayed in the XDCAM 
 Explorer and as media markers.

        <h4>File Format<a name="kanchor798"></a><a name="FileFormat"></a></h4>
        <p>A file format specifies the way in which data is stored 
 on your floppy disks or hard drive. In the Windows operating system, the 
 most common file format is the Microsoft .WAV format. However, <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> 
 can read and write to many other file formats so you can maintain compatibility 
 with other software and hardware configurations.</p>
        <h4>Frame Rate (Audio)<a name="kanchor799"></a><a name="FrameRateAudio"></a></h4>
        <p>Audio uses frame rates only for the purposes of synching 
 to video or other audio. In the latter case, the rate of 30 non-drop is 
 typically used. In the former case 30 drop is usually used.</p>
        <h4>Frame Rate (Video)<a name="FrameRateVideo"></a></h4>
        <p>The speed at which individual images in the video are displayed 
 on the screen during playback. A faster frame rate results in smoother 
 motion in the video. The television frame 
 rate in the US (NTSC) is 29.97 frames per second (fps). In many parts 
 of Europe and Japan, the television standard is PAL at 25 fps.</p>
        <h4><a name="FreqSpect"></a>Frequency Spectrum</h4>
        <p>The Frequency Spectrum of a signal refers to its range of 
 frequencies. In audio, the frequency range is basically 20 Hz to 20,000 
 Hz. The frequency spectrum sometimes refers to the distribution of these 
 frequencies. For example, bass-heavy sounds have a large frequency content 
 in the low end (20 Hz - 200 Hz) of the spectrum.</p>

        <h4>Gamma<a name="gamma"></a></h4>
        <p>Determines the brightness of the video and is used to compensate 
 for differences between the source and output video and sometimes needs 
 to be calibrated to match the source or destination. Higher gamma values 
 result in lighter or brighter video as displayed on your computer's monitor.</p>
        <h4>Gamut</h4>
        <p><span class="emphasis">Gamut</span> refers to 
 the complete range of something. In video editing, you want to ensure 
 that your colors are within the acceptable range for your broadcast standard. 
 When colors are outside the NTSC or PAL gamut, you can introduce image 
 problems or noise into the video stream. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Primary.ProOnly">You can use the video 
 scopes to analyze your video before rendering and correct out-of-gamut 
 colors with video plug-ins. For more information, see <a href="Video_Scopes.htm" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Monitoring video with scopes</u></span>."</a></MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h4><a name="In-Place"></a>In-Place Plug-In</h4>
        <p>An in-place plug-in processes audio data so that the output 
 length always matches the input length. A non-in-place plug-in's output 
 length need not match a given input length at any time: for example, Time 
 Stretch, Gapper/Snipper, Pitch-Shift (without preserving duration), and 
 some Vibrato settings can create an output that is longer or shorter than 
 the input. </p>
        <p>Plug-ins that generate tails when there is no more input 
 but otherwise operate in-place (such as reverb and delay) are considered 
 in-place plug-ins. </p>
        <h4><a name="Insertion_Point"></a>Insertion Point</h4>
        <p>The insertion point (also referred to as the cursor position) 
 is analogous to the cursor in a word processor. It is where pasted data 
 will be placed or other data may be inserted depending on the operation.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis">Telecine</span> 
 is the process of converting 24 fps (cinema) source to 30 fps video (television)

        <h4>Invert Data<a name="phase"></a></h4>
        <p>Inverting sound data reverses the polarity of a waveform 
 around its baseline. Inverting a waveform does not change the sound of 
 a file; however, when you mix different sound files, phase cancellation 
 can occur, producing a "hollow" sound. Inverting one of the 
 files can prevent phase cancellation.</p>
        <p>In the following example, the red line represents the baseline, 
 and the lower waveform is the inverted image of the upper waveform.</p>

        <p>The pixel aspect determines 
 whether the pixels are square (1.0) which refers to computers, or rectangular 
 (settings other than 1.000) which typically refers to televisions. The 
 pixel aspect ratio, together with the frame size, determine the frame 
 aspect ratio.</p>
        <h4><a name="Plug-In"></a>Plug-In</h4>
        <p>An effect that can be added to the product to enhance the 
 feature set. <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> supports all DirectX plug-ins. The built in 
 EQ, Compression and Dithering effects are also considered plug-ins because 
 they work in other DirectX-compatible applications.</p>
        <h4><a name="Plug-In_Chain"></a>Plug-In Chain</h4>
        <p>Plug-ins can stringed together into a chain so that the 
 output of one effect feeds into the input of another. This allows for 
 complex effects that could not otherwise be created.</p>
        <h4><a name="Pre-roll_Post-roll"></a><a name="kanchor803"></a>Pre-roll/Post-roll</h4>
        <p>Pre-roll is the amount of time elapsed before an event occurs. 
 Post-roll is the amount of time after the event. The time selection defines 
 the pre- and post-roll when recording into a selected event.</p>
        <h4><a name="Preset"></a>Preset</h4>
        <p>A snapshot of the current settings in a plug-in. Presets 
 are created and named so that you can easily get back to a sound that 
 you have previously created.</p>
        <p>A preset calls up a bulk setting of a function. If you like 
 the way you tweaked that EQ but do not want to have to spend the time 
 getting it back for later use, save it as a preset.</p>
        <h4><a name="Pulse_Code_Modulation__PCM_"></a>Pulse Code Modulation 
 (PCM)</h4>
        <p>PCM is the most common representation of uncompressed audio 
 signals. This method of coding yields the highest fidelity possible when 
 using digital storage.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor804"></a>Pulldown<a name="pulldown"></a></h4>
        <p>In telecine conversion, fields are 
 added to convert 24 fps film to 30 fps video.</p>
        <p>In 2-3 pulldown, for example, the first frame is scanned 
 into two fields, the second frame is scanned into three fields, and so 
 on for the duration of the film. 2-3 pulldown is the standard for NTSC 
 broadcasts of 24p material. Use 2-3 pulldown when printing to tape, but 
 not when you intend to use the rendered video in a <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> project. Removing 
 2-3 pulldown is inefficient because the pulldown fields that are created 
 for frame 3 span two frames:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/pulldown.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>24 fps film (top) and resulting NTSC video with 2-3 pulldown fields (bottom)</p>
        <p>Use 2-3-3-2 pulldown when you plan to use your rendered 
 video as source media. When removing 2-3-3-2 pulldown, Frame three is 
 discarded, and the pulldown fields in the remaining frames are merged:</p>

        <h4><a name="Quadraphonic"></a>Quadraphonic</h4>
        <p>A mixing implementation that allows for four discrete audio 
 channels. These are usually routed to two front speakers and two back 
 speakers to create immersive audio mixes.</p>
        <h4><a name="Quantization"></a>Quantization</h4>
        <p>The process by which measurements are rounded to discrete 
 values. Specifically with respect to audio, quantization is a function 
 of the analog to digital conversion process. The continuous variation 
 of the voltages of a analog audio signal are quantized to discrete amplitude 
 values represented by digital, binary numbers. The number of bits available 
 to describe these values determines the resolution or accuracy of quantization. 
 For example, if you have 8-bit analog to digital converters, the varying 
 analog voltage must be quantized to 1 of 256 discrete values; a 16-bit 
 converter has 65,536 values.</p>
        <h4><a name="Quantization_Noise"></a>Quantization Noise</h4>
        <p>A result of describing an analog signal in discrete digital 
 terms (<span class="emphasis">see</span> <a href="#Quantization" title="" alt="" class="MCXref xref">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Quantization</u></span>"</a>). 
 This noise is most easily heard in low resolution digital sounds that 
 have low bit depths and is similar to a "shhhhh" 
 type sound while the audio is playing. It becomes more apparent when the 
 signal is at low levels, such as when doing a fade out.</p>

        <h4><a name="Region"></a>Region</h4>
        <p>A subsection of a sound file. You can define any number 
 of regions in a project or media file.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor805"></a><a name="Resample"></a>Resample</h4>
        <p>The act of recalculating samples in a sound file at a different 
 rate than the file was originally recorded. If a sample is resampled at 
 a lower rate, sample points are removed from the sound file decreasing 
 its size, but also decreasing its available frequency range. When resampling 
 to a higher sample rate, extra sample points in the sound file are interpolated. 
 This increases the size of the sound file but does not increase the quality. 
 When down-sampling one must be aware of aliasing. <span class="emphasis">See </span><a href="#Aliasing" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Aliasing</u></span>."</a><span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> will automatically resample all audio that is added to

        <h4><a name="Sample"></a>Sample</h4>
        <p>The word sample is used in many different (and often confusing) 
 ways when talking about digital sound. Here are some of the different 
 meanings:</p>
        <p>A discrete point in time that a sound signal is divided 
 into when digitizing. For example, an audio CD-ROM contains 44,100 samples 
 per second. Each sample is really only a number that contains the amplitude 
 value of a waveform measured over time.</p>
        <p>A sound that has been recorded in a digital format; used 
 by musicians who make short recordings of musical instruments to be used 
 for composition and performance of music or sound effects. These recordings 
 are called samples. In this help system, we try to use <span class="emphasis">sound 
 file</span> instead of <span class="emphasis">sample</span> 
 whenever referring to a digital recording.</p>
        <p>The act of recording sound digitally, i.e. to sample an 
 instrument means to digitize and store it.</p>
        <h4><a name="Sample_Rate"></a>Sample Rate</h4>
        <p>The sample rate (also referred to as the sampling rate or 
 sampling frequency) is the number of samples per second used to store 
 a sound. High sample rates, such as 44,100 Hz provide higher fidelity 
 than lower sample rates, such as 11,025 Hz. However, more storage space 
 is required when using higher sample rates.</p>
        <h4><a name="Sample_Size"></a>Sample Size</h4>
        <p><span class="emphasis">See </span><a href="#BitDepth" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Bit Depth</u></span>."</a>
        </p>
        <h4><a name="Sample_Value"></a>Sample Value</h4>
        <p>The sample value (also referred to as sample amplitude) 
 is the number stored by a single sample. In 16-bit audio, these values 
 range from -32768 to 32767. In 8-bit audio, they range from -128 to 127. 
 The maximum allowed sample value is often referred to as 100% or 0 dB.</p>
        <h4><a name="Shortcut_Menu"></a>Shortcut Menu</h4>
        <p>A context-sensitive menu that appears when you right-click 
 on certain areas of the screen. The functions available in the shortcut 
 menu depend on the object being clicked on as well as the state of the 
 program. As with any menu, you can select an item from the shortcut menu 
 to perform an operation. Shortcut menus are used frequently for quick 
 access to many commands. An example of a shortcut menu can be found by 
 right-clicking on any waveform display in a data window.</p>
        <h4><a name="Signal-to-Noise_Ratio"></a>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
        <p>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measurement of the 
 difference between a recorded signal and noise levels. A high SNR is always 
 the goal.</p>
        <p>The maximum signal-to-noise ratio of digital audio is determined 
 by the number of bits per sample. In 16-bit audio, the signal to noise 
 ratio is 96 dB while in 8-bit audio its 48 dB. However, in practice this 
 SNR is never achieved, especially when using low-end electronics.</p>
        <h4><a name="Small_Computer_Systems_Interface__SCSI_"></a>Small 
 Computer Systems Interface (SCSI)</h4>
        <p>A standard interface protocol for connecting devices to 
 your computer. The SCSI bus can accept up to seven devices at a time including 
 CD ROM drives, hard drives and samplers.</p>

 of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)</h4>
        <p>SMPTE timecode is used to synchronize time between devices. 
 The timecode is calculated in Hours:Minutes:Second:Frames, where Frames

        <h4><a name="Zero-crossing"></a>Zero-crossing</h4>
        <p>A zero-crossing is the point where a fluctuating signal 
 crosses the zero-amplitude axis. By making edits at zero-crossings with 
 the same slope, the chance of creating glitches is minimized. The fade 
 edit edges setting is used to make zero crossing at event edges by fading 
 the waveform to 0-amplitude over a short period of time.</p>
        <h4><a name="Zipper_noise"></a>Zipper noise</h4>
        <p>Zipper noise occurs when you apply 
 a changing gain to a signal, such as when fading out. If the gain does 
 not change in small enough increments, zipper noise can become very noticeable. 
 Fades are accomplished using 64-bit arithmetic, thereby creating no audible 
 zipper noise. </p>

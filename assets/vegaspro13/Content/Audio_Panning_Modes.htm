        <p>When you pan stereo audio tracks, 5.1 
 surround tracks, or busses, you can right-click 
 the fader handle (or surround panner) and choose a pan type to change 
 the panning model.</p>
        <p class="tip" data-mc-conditions="Primary.QSG">If you want to set the default pan type for new tracks, set a 
 track's pan type, and then use the Set 
 Default Track Properties dialog to set that track's pan type as the 
 default. For more information, see <a href="Setting_Default_Track_Properties.htm" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Setting default track properties</u></span>."</a></p>

                        <p>This mode is most useful for panning 
 stereo files. As you pan across the stereo field, the stereo image appears 
 to move across the speakers. As you pan toward either side, the signal 
 from the opposite channel is added to the channel you are panning toward 
 until at the extreme both channels are sent to a single channel at full 
 volume.</p>
                        <p>This mode uses a linear panning curve.</p>
                        <p class="warn">You can introduce 
 clipping when channels are added. Monitor the meters in the Master Bus window and adjust the track volume accordingly.</p>

                        <p>In a stereo project, this mode can help you 
 adjust the relative signal levels of the channels in stereo source material. 
 As you pan from the center to either side, the opposite channel begins 
 at the specified center value (0 dB -3 dB, or -6 dB), and decays to -infinity. 
 The signal in the side you are panning toward progresses from the specified 
 center value (0 dB -3 dB, or -6 dB) to 0 dB.</p>
                        <p>This panning mode uses a linear panning curve.</p>
                        <p>For example, when you pan fully right, the right 
 channel is played at 0 dB and the left channel is not audible. As you 
 pan to the center, each channel is attenuated to the specified center 
 value (0 dB -3 dB, or -6 dB). As you pan to the left, the left channel 
 is played at 0 dB, and the right channel is not audible.</p>

                        <p>With the <span class="uielement">Balance 
 (0 dB center)</span> setting, no gain or cut is applied when you're panned 
 to the center, which can make the center seem louder.</p>

                        <p>Panning in a 5.1 surround project follows the 
 same rules: as you pan from the center to any channel in a 5.1 surround 
 project, the signal in the channel you are panning toward progresses from 
 the specified center value to 0 dB. The signal in the channel you are 
 panning away from begins at the specified center value and decays to -infinity.</p>

                        <p>This mode allows you to pan between pairs of 
 adjacent speakers in 5.1 
 surround projects using a constant power model. This mode is optimized 
 for theater-style speaker placement. In stereo projects, Film mode functions 
 identically to Constant Power.</p>
                        <p>As you drag the pan point to the center speaker, 
 the sound becomes diffused through the front and rear speakers. When the 
 track is panned fully to the center speaker, there is no output from the 
 front and rear speakers.</p>
                        <p>Dragging the pan point to the center of the 
 surround panner sends the signal to all speakers.</p>
                        <div class="note">
                            <p>If you're panning fully to a single speaker, 
 you may notice that some signal is mixed to the opposite speaker. This 
 is because the ideal placement for surround speakers does not match the 
 representation in the surround panner. For example, panning to the front-left 
 speaker produces a low-level signal in the rear-left speaker.</p>
                            <p>This is because your front-left speaker should be positioned 30° left of 
 center and the speaker in the surround panner is located 45° left of center. 
 To produce a true 45° left-of-center pan, the signal is panned between 
 the front- and rear-left speaker. </p>

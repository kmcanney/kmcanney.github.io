        <h2><a name="kanchor330"></a>Shooting multicamera video</h2>
        <p>When shooting multicamera video, there are a few key components to consider 
 before getting started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p>If possible, 
 use the same make and model of camera and the same settings. Otherwise, 
 you may need to do significant color correction in order to match the 
 look between cameras.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>If possible, 
 provide a single timecode source to all cameras.</p>
                <p>With synchronized timecode, <span class="PrimaryProductName">Vegas Pro</span> 
 can lay out multicamera media in perfect synchronization. Otherwise, you'll 
 need to manually 
 adjust the alignment between clips. For more information, see <a href="Synchronizing_Video_in_Multicamera_Projects.htm" title="" alt="" class="period MCXref xref xrefperiod" xrefformat="{quote}{color #009ccc}{u}{paratext}{/u}{/color}.{quote}">"<span style="color: #009ccc;" class="mcFormatColor"><u>Synchronizing video in multicamera projects</u></span>."</a></p>
                <p>Unsynchronized timecode between two cameras—even of the same type—drifts 
 as much as one second per hour. Likewise, date/time stamps also drift 
 and can only be used for approximate layout. If you only need two cameras 
 on your shoot, be aware that some Sony cameras (e.g. HVR-V1) can synchronize 
 timecode (using a feature called “TC Link”) over IEEE-1394.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Set the 
 date and time in each camera. The closer these are, the better the approximate 
 layout will be. Even if you’re using a master timecode source, you should 
 set the date/time as a backup.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Before or 
 after each scene, record a synchronization point. It is preferable to 
 use a video slate board for this purpose, but you can also employ a loud 
 and visible hand clap. You can also use a flash from a still camera, but 
 you must disable any red-eye reduction, as this can cause multiple flashes. 
 A fast camera flash combined with a fast shutter speed can be problematic 
 as well.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the synchronization method you choose, it must be visible 
 by all cameras.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If you forget 
 to record a synchronization point, you'll have to align the clips using 
 another reference point, such as something consistent in the audio or 
 video. Be aware that in distant shots, the audio captured by the camera’s 
 microphone will be delayed from the video (1 frame for every 11.5 meters). 
 </p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>At least 
 one of the cameras should be recording the audio you’ll 
 use for the final edit. Alternatively, if you’re using dual-system sound, 
 you can record audio on another device altogether. If you are shooting 
 a musical performance, you might even be using the studio-recorded audio 
 track. If you record audio on multiple cameras, you'll be able to switch 
 between it along with the video if you choose. </p>
